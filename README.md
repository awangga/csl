# SPs ITB Citation Style Language (CSL) Guide

Sekolah Pascasarjana (SPs) ITB provides a Citation Style Language (CSL) which can be used in supported reference manager software, to format references and bibliography in conformance with [SPs ITB guidelines for master's thesis and doctoral dissertation](http://www.sps.itb.ac.id/in/pedoman-tesis-dan-disertasi/).

SPS ITB provides tutorial to use the CSL with the following software:

* [Microsoft Word 2010/2013/2016](https://products.office.com/en/word) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), for Windows and macOS

As CSL is an open and widely supported format, it is also usable in other software, e.g. [LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org), [Mendeley](https://mendeley.com/), and Linux-based operating systems like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). Please refer to your reference manager's documentation on how to use this CSL in your preferred software, or you can [contribute to this documentation by submitting a GitHub pull request](https://github.com/itb-sps/csl).

### Collect Documents

Before you can insert a citation, you need to collect documents first in Zotero. Although there are many ways to collect documents, this guide will describe the most common ones:

1. By adding a paper's PDF file

2. Using the Web Importer plugin (recommended)

3. Adding manually (as a last resort)

#### Collect Documents from PDF files

If you already have PDF files of the papers you want to add, simply drag-and-drop PDF files to the Zotero Desktop.

Alternatively, you can also click **Add > Store Copy of File...**

#### Collect Documents using the Web Importer plugin (recommended)

The Web Importer is the most convenient way to add documents, it will even download the PDF file for you if available.

1. [Install Zotero Browser Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/) for your favorite browser.

### Inserting Citations

1. Create a Word document for your thesis or dissertation, using the [template provided by SPs ITB](http://www.sps.itb.ac.id/in/pedoman-tesis-dan-disertasi/).

2. In **Zotero** ribbon tab, click **Document Preferences**.

   a. In **Citation Style**, choose **Institut Teknologi Bandung - Sekolah Pascasarjana**.
   b. In **Language**, select **Bahasa Indonesia** or **English** based on the language of your thesis/dissertation.

3. In the place where you want to put the citation, click **Zotero > Add/Edit Citation**.

   Type the keywords of your document (author, title, year, etc.) then double-click it or press Enter.


### Inserting Bibliography

In the place where you want to put the bibliography, click **Zotero > Add/Edit Bibliography**.

The bibliography will be inserted using syntax according to SPs ITB guidelines.

**Important:** you will still need to ensure correct formatting according to [Pedoman Tesis dan Disertasi SPs ITB](http://www.sps.itb.ac.id/in/pedoman-tesis-dan-disertasi/), because the following are not controlled by CSL:

* font and font size
* paragraph justification
